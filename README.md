    Be sure to have Python 3.10 installed‚Äîif you use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme), simply run:

    ```shell
    pyenv install 3.10
    ```

1.  Clone your fork locally and install dependencies.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brandy path/to/brandy
    cd path/to/brandy
    poetry env use $(cat .python-version)
    poetry install
    ```

    Next up, simply activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install
    ```
